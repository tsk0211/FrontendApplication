This is a Vite-powered project.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

-   **Node.js** (v14.18.0 or higher) - You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Steps to Install and Run the Application

1. **Clone the repository**:

    Clone the project to your local machine by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```

Navigate into the project folder:

Change your working directory to the project folder:

Running the Application
Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the application locally.

Start the development server:

Run the following command to start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or with Yarn:

```

This will start the server at `http://localhost:3000/` (or a different port if configured). Open this URL in your browser to see the app in action.

Building for Production

Build the application:

To create an optimized production build, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

Or with Yarn:

This will generate a dist/ directory with the production-ready code.

Preview the production build:

To preview the production build locally, you can run:

```bash
npm run preview
```

Or with Yarn:

```bash
yarn preview
```

This will serve the optimized build at http://localhost:5000/ for testing.
